# Noct Morphing Waves: An Interactive 3D Experiment

## Overview

Dive into the mesmerizing world of generative art with this interactive 3D experiment. Using Three.js and custom shaders, this project explores the beauty of procedural animation and user interaction in the browser.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Waves**: Experience a hypnotic display of morphing, concentric waves that respond to user input.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Manipulate the waves' behavior with mouse movements and touch gestures.
- **Glitch Aesthetics**: Toggle a 'bug' mode to introduce controlled chaos into the animation.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes for an immersive experience on any device.

## Technical Highlights

- Leverages Three.js for efficient 3D rendering in WebGL
- Custom vertex and fragment shaders for unique visual effects
- Optimized performance using instanced geometry
- Smooth animations with RequestAnimationFrame

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the organic patterns found in nature, the fluidity of water, and the abstract beauty of mathematical functions. It aims to create a meditative, yet engaging visual experience that blurs the line between code and art.

## For Creators and Designers
